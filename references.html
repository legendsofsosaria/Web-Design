            <li>Overall development/design including layout and responsiveness will be evaluated.</li>
            <li>From this website’s homepage, include a link to the cross-reference page. Ensure the website’s homepage is named index.html</li>

    <li>Cross-reference Page
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>At the completion of the small business website, you will include a web page that links to all requirements 
			to aid in the marking of your website. Now is a good time to begin that page by creating a list of all requirements, 
			and when completed, link it to the project website. 
				<ul>
                    <li>Each item on the cross-reference page must be a hyperlink to the associated item within the website and 
					include a description of what the link is going to show. Your website must demonstrate the appropriate, relevant, 
					and functional use of each of the required features. </li>
                    <li>The cross-reference page must be accessible from the home page of the small business website. It must be part of the 
					project website. The cross-reference page should be the last thing to be completed by you. Add the link to the extreme right 
					of your navigational menu. </li>
                    <li>Note: If submitting a copy of the completed web project to the business or organization, remove the link to the cross-reference
					page. The link to the cross-reference page is only required for the copy of the web project that is submitted for marking purposes. </li>
                </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			The cross-reference page should include the following: 
				<ul>
				<li>Nine Websites:</li> 
				<li>Nine websites in total are required from nine different domains, as listed below.</li>
					<ul>
					<li>Three websites—Similar in business nature to your site.<br>
					Links to three websites similar to the site you are planning to build for the business. 
					Give a one-sentence description of what you like about each site.</li>
					<li>Three websites—Downloadable sites.<br>
					Links to three sites from which you can download free components for use in your project website for the business 
					(i.e., graphics, sound files, etc.). Give a one-sentence description of what you like about each site.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
	</ol>
		<h2>Websites similar in nature to my website:</h2>
		<p>I liked the clean looking black footer from Whitesail Bakery, which I ended up using on my site.
		I got the idea of having a bakery photo on my site from LF Bakery. Sweet Sadie's Custom Cakes I liked
		how you could click on the image gallery items to enlarge them. I used this concept for my gallery.
		I also listed my old website here, which is where I got all the information from.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://whitesailsbakery.com/">Whitesail Bakery</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://lfbakeryhalifax.com/">LF Bakery</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.sweetsadiescustomcakes.com/weddings/">Sweet Sadie's Custom Cakes</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://contactgeekygamers.wixsite.com/my-site-3">Old Art & Pastry Website</a></li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Downloadable Sites</h2>
		<p>I used assets from Unsplash, Pexels, Google Fonts, DaFont, and OpenGameArt.
		Unsplash has a great selection of stock photos. Pexels has some great videos available for use. 
		Google Fonts has a wide font selection, as does DaFont. OpenGameArt has a variety of media available for use for video games.
		I've used it extensively for personal projects. I selected my music from there.</p>

		<h2>Technical Sites</h2>
		<p>I used a combination of W3 schools and what we learned in our textbook to create my website.
		There were a few tutorials I referenced on W3 schools to make some things for my website.
		I used the Modal Image tutorial on my <a href="gallery.html">image gallery</a>.
		I used the slideshow tutorial for my <a href="index.html">front page</a>. 
		I used the last assignment in combination with the redirect webpage info to make the JavaScript for my 
		<a href="order.html">webform</a>.
		I used the tutorial on how to create a mobile nav bar to hide nav bar on mobile devices. 
		Click on unicode cupcake to display the hidden nav menu.
